Neural networks: a brief history
- Warren McCulloch 1943

first AI winter, thanks to msiinterpretation of theory

PDP - parallel distributed processing released in 1986

Age of deep learning is here
- a machine capabale of perceiving, recognizing and identifying its surroundings without any hujan training or control

Education at Bat: 7 Principles for Educators
1. Play the whole game
2. Make the game worth playing
3. Work on the hard parts

The software
- fastai
- pytorch
- python

fastai: A Layered API for Deep Learning

Getting a GPU deep learning server

Machine learns from experience

input ->
weight-> model -> results

Bring on the neural networks
- universal approximation theorem - can solve any problem to any level of accuracy, in theory

Bring on SGD!

Terms
- architecture
- parameters
- predictions
- independent variables
- measure of performance - loss
- labels

Limitations inherent to ML
- a model cannot be created without data
- a model can only learn to operate on patterns seen in the input data used to train it
- learning approach only creates predictions, not recommended actions
- need labels
