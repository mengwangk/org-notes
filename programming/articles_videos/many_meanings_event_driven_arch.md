0:00 What people mean by EDA

00:51 How he came to write down common patterns of EDA and hold this talk

02:45 4 patterns detected

People normally call their system "event-driven" if at least one of those patterns is in place

**03:20 Pattern 1: Event Notification**

Generic code notifies specific code by events for example GUI elements

**08:33 Events vs Commands**

Events just indicate a change without expecting any particular response Commands are telling some
service what to do

**11:30 Pro: Decoupling**

**13:50 Contra: inability to understand what is going on by stepping through the code**

**14:53 Pattern 2: Event-carried State Transfer**

Subscribers don't ask for additional information after an event occured, all necessary state is
given in the events. Subscribers copy whatever they need. Pro: can greatly reduce network traffic.
Better availability because of the copied data Contra: consistency It's Less used

**20:51 Pattern 3: Event Sourcing**

Ability to rebuild the full state of the system by a persisted log of events Event Sourcing works
with your data like version control systems work with your code Pro: "time traveling" like for
debugging. use a copy of the system, feed it the events and see what happened

**32:11 Can be a very nice system development-wise**

**33:43 Downside of Event Sourcing**

- unfamiliar
- when I rebuild the state from the log I can't replay answers of external systems unless I record all answers as kind of events
- old event schema still has to work somehow with new versions of code
- IDs that are generated during replay are probably different than before
- Asynchrony is difficult for people (but it's optional. You can synchronously use event sourcing)
- Versioning (Snapshots can make that easier)

(Conclusion for me: Always remember that replay has to work for everything, otherwise there is no
point in using event sourcing)

38:46 Which events to record in the event store?

Two events happen for a state change. One shows the intention (command), the other shows all the
different changes that were done. Events that show intention often hold specific knowledge, the
EventStore normally should stay generic (git only knows txt, not the used programming language
syntax) It's important to think about which of those events are important to persist. Probably both.

43:31 Pattern 4: CQRS

Separate components for updating the system and reading from the system Different views of the data
are pretty common (e.g. a reporting database), the important thing here is that the command model is
never used for reading from outside

47:39 Conclusion : How to use the knowledge about those 4 patterns

When you hear about a system being "event-driven" ask questions to find out what patterns they use.
Because the term "event-driven" is too imprecise. Have enough knowledge about each pattern to know
where the problems are and what consequences they cause.
