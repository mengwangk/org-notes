[Do's and Don'ts of Error Handling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTM_b7EJg5E&t=1341s)

Fault tolerance cannot be achieve using a single computer
- it might fail

We have to use several computers
- concurrency
- parallel programming
- distributed programming
- physics
- engineering
- **message passing is inevitable**

Programming language should make this doable.

Evidence for SW failure is all around us.

How can we make software that works reasonably well even if there errors in the software

Requirements

R1 - Concurrency
R2 - Error encapsulation
R3 - Fault tolerance
R4 - Fault identification
R5 - Code upgrade
R6 - Stable storage

Silent programming error

Rump's Royal Pain

2 systems are the same if they obey observational equivalence.
Important is the interface, not the programming language.
